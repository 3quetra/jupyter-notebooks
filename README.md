# Educational Projects in Jupyter Notebooks
**This repository contains only educational projects that were performed in Jupyter Notebook during my CodeCademy courses. The purpose of each of them is to practice individual studying modules and consolidate the result as an active professional skill.** 

### Brief projects description:
1. **"Frida Calo" Project**
    
    Project for the Lists module practicing. The task is to make simple lists of the artist's work for a potential digital guide. The project is __not a complete application__, but only demonstrates the skills of applying lists within Jupyter Notebook. 
    
1. **"Reggie Linear Regression" Project**

    Modules to be used: loops, lists as well as basic arithmetic. The goal is to create a function that will find a line of best fit on the Linear Regression graph when given a set of data.
