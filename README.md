# Educational Projects in Jupyter Notebooks
**This repository contains only educational projects that were performed in Jupyter Notebook during my CodeCademy courses. The purpose of each of them is to practice individual studying modules and consolidate the result as an active professional skill.**

## Brief projects' description (ordered descendingly by the completion):

### 10. "Cleaning US Census Data"

The goal of this project is to make US Census data scalable and repeatable, converting data from multiple CSV files to pandas' DataFrames, as well as to collect some interesting insights from it and create informative visualisations as a result. 

-----------------------

### 9. "Life expectancy by country"

The goal of this project is to investigate a dataset containing information about the average life expectancy in 158 different countries and, using statistical instruments, analyse an example country's location on a GDP scale based on the average life expectancy of this country.

-----------------------

### 8. "Chocolate Scraping with Beautiful Soup"

The goal of this project is to analyze and manipulate data displayed in a table on a website: `https://content.codecademy.com/courses/beautifulsoup/cacao/index.html`, using BeautifulSoup and pandas that should help us transform this webpage into a DataFrame.

-----------------------

### 7. "Visualizing World Cup Data"

The goal of this project is using Seaborn explore data from the Fifa World Cup from 1930-2014 to analyze trends and discover insights about football game.

-----------------------

### 6. "Page Visits Funnel"

The goal of this project is to analyze data on visits to a website of Cool T-Shirts Inc by building a funnel via Pandas.

### 3."Graphs and Charts for Teacher"

The goal of this project is to create some graphs to help a high school math teacher, using Matplotlib and a bit of NumPy.

-----------------------
    
### 2."Linear Regression"

The goal is to create a function that will find a line of best fit on the Linear Regression graph when given a set of data. Modules to be used: loops, lists as well as basic arithmetic.
