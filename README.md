# Educational Projects in Jupyter Notebooks
**This repository contains only educational projects that were performed in Jupyter Notebook during my CodeCademy courses. The purpose of each of them is to practice individual studying modules and consolidate the result as an active professional skill.**

## Brief projects' description (ordered descendingly by the completion):

### 14. Data Transformation: ["Company Transformation"](./data_transformation/company_transformation.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to apply data transformation techniques to better understand the companyâ€™s data and help to answer important questions from the management team.

-----------------------

### 13. Explorative Data Analysis (EDA): ["Diagnosing Diabetes"](./eda_diagnosing_diabetes/eda.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to explore data that looks at how certain diagnostic factors affect the diabetes outcome of women patients. We are going to use EDA skills to help inspect, clean, and validate the data.

-----------------------

### 12. Visualisaton using boxplot: ["Healthcare in Different States"](./healthcare_in_different_states/healthcare_in_different_states.ipynb)

In this project, we will use boxplots to investigate the way hospitals in different states across the United States charge their patients for medical procedures.

-----------------------

### 11. Visualisation using histogram: ["Traveling to Acadia"](./traveling_to_acadia/traveling_to_acadia.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to inform customers of a travel agency about the best time to visit Acadia to see flowers in bloom. We will use flower bloom data, and flight information to create visualisation and recommend the best time of year for someone to make a trip to Maine.

-----------------------

### 10. Data wrangling, tidying and visualisation: ["Cleaning US Census Data"](./us_census_data/cleaning_us_census_data.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to make US Census data scalable and repeatable, converting data from multiple CSV files to pandas' DataFrames, as well as to collect some interesting insights from it and create informative visualisations as a result. 

-----------------------

### 9. Analysis using statistical instruments: ["Life expectancy by country"](./life_expectancy_by_country/life_expectancy_by_country.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to investigate a dataset containing information about the average life expectancy in 158 different countries and, using statistical instruments, analyse an example country's location on a GDP scale based on the average life expectancy of this country.

-----------------------

### 8. WebScraping with Beautiful Soup: ["Chocolate bars"](./web_scraping_with_BeautifulSoup/chocolate_scraping.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to analyze and manipulate data displayed in a table on a website: `https://content.codecademy.com/courses/beautifulsoup/cacao/index.html`, using BeautifulSoup and pandas that should help us transform this webpage into a DataFrame.

-----------------------

### 7. Visualisation using Seaborn: ["Visualizing World Cup Data"](./visualizing_world_cup_data/visualizing_fifa_data.ipynb)

The goal of this project is using Seaborn explore data from the Fifa World Cup from 1930-2014 to analyze trends and discover insights about football game.

-----------------------

### 6. Building Funnel via pandas: ["Page Visits"](./page_visits_funnel/page_visits_funnel.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to analyze data on visits to a website of Cool T-Shirts Inc by building a funnel via pandas.

-----------------------

### 5. Analysis via pandas: ["A/B Testing for ShoeFly.com"](./ab_testing_for_shoe_shop/ab_testing_for_shoe_shop.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to analyze the data, using Pandas aggregate measures, for an online shoe store ShoeFly.com that is performing an A/B testing.

-----------------------

### 4. Analysis via pandas: ["Petal Power Store Inventory"](./petal_power_inventory/petal_power_inventory.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to help to analyze a shop-inventory,  using pandas, for a chain of gardening stores called Petal Power.

-----------------------

### 3. Visualisation using Matplotlib: ["Graphs and Charts for Teacher"](./graphs_for_teacher.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to create some graphs to help a high school math teacher, using Matplotlib and a bit of NumPy.

-----------------------
    
### 2. Python functions: ["Linear Regression"](./linear_regression.ipynb)

The goal is to create a function that will find a line of best fit on the Linear Regression graph when given a set of data. Modules to be used: loops, lists as well as basic arithmetic. 
    
-----------------------

### 1. Python Lists: ["Frida Calo"](./frida_calo.ipynb)
    
Project for the Lists module practicing. The task is to make simple lists of the artist's work for a potential digital guide. The project is __not a complete application__, but only demonstrates the skills of applying lists within Jupyter Notebook.
