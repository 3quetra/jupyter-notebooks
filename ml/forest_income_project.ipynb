    "In this project, we will be using a dataset containing census information from UCI’s Machine Learning Repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this census data with a random forest, we will try to predict whether or not a person makes more than $50,000.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s begin by investigating the data available to us. Click on the file income.csv and take a look. Notice the first row of the dataset contains the names of our columns. What columns do you think might be helpful in predicting a person’s income?\n",

    "You can find more detailed descriptions of the columns on UCI’s Machine Learning Repository.\n",

    "\n",
    "Go back to the income.py file. We want to get all of that data into a Pandas DataFrame. Use the pd.read_csv() function using \"income.csv\" as a parameter and store the result in a variable named income_data. Since the first row of our file contains the names of the columns, we also want to add the argument header = 0.\n",

    "4.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a small problem with our data that is a little hard to catch — every string has an extra space at the start. For example, the first row’s native-country is \" United-States\", but we want it to be \"United-States\". This is happening because in income.csv there are spaces after the commas. To fix this, we can add the parameter delimiter = \", \" to our read_csv() function.\n",

    "Now that we have our data imported into a DataFrame, we can begin putting it in a format that our Random Forest can work with. To do this, we need to separate the labels from the rest of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, the labels are in the column called \"income\". We want to grab only this column. You can get a single column from a DataFrame using this syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "one_column = data_frame_name[[\"column_name\"]]\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll also want to pick which columns to use when trying to predict income. For now, let’s select \"age\", \"capital-gain\", \"capital-loss\", \"hours-per-week\", and \"sex\". Create a new variable named data that contains only those columns. The syntax for this is very similar to selecting only one column:\n",

    "many_columns = data_frame_name[[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]]\n",

    "Finally, we want to split our data and labels into a training set and a test set. We’ll use the training set to build the random forest, and the test set to see how accurate it is. Use the train_test_split() function to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "train_test_split() returns four values — name them train_data, test_data, train_labels, and test_labels. When calling train_test_split(), it should take three arguments — data, labels and random_state = 1.\n",

    "There seems to be a problem with using the column \"sex\" when training the random forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that column, there are values like \"Male\" and \"Female\". Random forests can’t use columns that contain Strings — they have to be continuous values like integers or floats. We’ll solve this problem soon, but for now, let’s remove the \"sex\" column when creating data.\n",

    "income_data[\"sex-int\"] = income_data[\"sex\"].apply(lambda row: 0 if row == \"Male\" else 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a new column called \"sex-int\" in the income_data DataFrame. Every row in that new column contains a 0 if the row’s \"sex\" column contained \"Male\" and a 1 otherwise.\n",

    "Since the majority of the data comes from \"United-States\", it might make sense to make a column where every row that contains \"United-States\" becomes a 0 and any other country becomes a 1. Use the syntax from creating the \"sex-int\" column to create a \"country-int\" column.\n",
    "\n",
    "When mapping Strings to numbers like this, it is important to make sure that continuous numbers make sense. For example, it wouldn’t make much sense to map \"United-States\" to 0, \"Germany\" to 1, and \"Mexico\" to 2. If we did this, we’re saying that Mexico is more similar to Germany than it is to the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you had values in a column like \"low\", \"medium\", and \"high\" mapping those values to 0, 1, and 2 would make sense because their representation as Strings is also continuous.\n",
